/*
üóÉÔ∏è DataWarehouse SQL Project ‚Äì Schema Setup

This script initializes a clean SQL environment for a data warehousing project. It performs the following operations:
Drops and recreates the DataWarehouse database if it already exists (‚ö†Ô∏è This action is destructive and will delete all existing data).
Creates three structured schemas within the database:
        bronze ‚Äì for raw, ingested data
        silver ‚Äì for cleaned and transformed data
        gold ‚Äì for aggregated, analytics-ready data

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Running this script will permanently delete the existing DataWarehouse database (if present). Please ensure you have backups before execution.

This setup follows the medallion architecture pattern commonly used in modern data engineering workflows.
